        <h2>What Are 3D Tactile Maps?</h2>
        <p>
            3D Tactile Maps are physical, touch based-models of that well help
            visually impaired individuals understand spaces through their sense of touch.
            Instead of relying on visual details, tactile mapse use raise surfaces, textures, 
            and 3D strcutures to repesent geographic features, buildings, and other important landmarks.
            By feeling these models, users can gain a better understanding of spatial relationships.<br><br>
            These maps can be 3D-printed, laser-cut, or handcrafted, and are designed to make environemts easier to 
            explore independently and safely.
        </p>
        <h3>How Do They Help?</h3>
        <p>
            Tactile maps provide:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spatial Awareness:</strong> They help users understand the layout of an area, including distances and directions between key locations.</li>
                <li><strong>Navigation Confidence:</strong> They support independent movement, especially in large or unfamiliar space like a college campus.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessiblity:</strong> They help ensure that visually impaired individuals are included in planning and navigating physical environemts.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning Support:</strong> Tactile Maps allow users to memorize routes or understand orientation before actually walking the space.</li>
                <li><strong>Model:</strong> These kind of maps also serves as a 3D Model of a college campus, like ASU!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Why This Matters?</h3>
        <p>Navigating a large campus such as ASU can be difficult for visually impaired students, especially without accessible tools.
                A 3D Tactile Map provides a clear, touch-based way to understand the layout, exactly how it is with right proportions, before moving through it. 
                It improves the independence, confidence and safety, while navigating through a particular environment.<br><br>
                These maps also serves as physical models of the environemt, helping not only the visually-impaired individuals, 
                it does help users to understand building locations, pathways, and spatial relationships in a hands-on intuitive way.

        <h2>About Our Project</h2>
        <h3>Including Braille Labels</h3>
        <p>An Important part of our 3D Tactile Maps is the inclusion of Braille building abbreviations.<br>
            Each major building on the ASU Tempe campus is marked with raised brailled text that represents it's official building code.</p>
            <p>This ensures that visually impaired useres can:<br></p>
            <ul>
                <li> Identify and navigate buidling independently.</li>
                <li> Recognize campus landmarks quickly.</li>
                <li> Connect touch-based maps with real-world locations.</li>
                <li> Form mental associations between abbreviations and places.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The combination of <strong>raised 3D strucutres</strong> and <strong>Braille lables</strong> makes the maps practical,
            accessible, and meaningful.

        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
            <p>
            <strong> Visually impaired students at ASU face challenges navigating the campus due to a lack of accessible tactile maps.
                This limitation affects their independence, safety and ease of movement across campus.</strong><br><br>
                <i>Our goal is to Enhance Accessiblity for visually Impaired individuals.
                    The map will incorporate tactile lettering and braille to highlight 
                    key campus features, including primary pathways, entrances, roads,
                    crosswalks, transit-stops, notable landmarks and potential mobility obstacles.   </i>
